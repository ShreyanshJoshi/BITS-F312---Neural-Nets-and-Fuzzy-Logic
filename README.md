# BITS-F312---Neural-Nets-and-Fuzzy-Logic
This repository contains code of the weekly labs and my solutions to the 2 assignments for the course for the year 2021-22.
**Labs** - Conducted on a weekly basis, and are meant for just introducing the coding part of a particular topic to students. Usually, some code is already implemented and students are given some homework where they have to write similar code for a slightly different tasks.

**Assignment1** - Given a set of coloured images labeled either as "fire" or "not_fire", the task was to process this data as you see fit and create a model that will classify the unlabeled data present in the test folder. Convolutional neural networks were supposed to be used for the same (without using transfer learning).

Note: Output of some cells (usually such cells included printing a very long list, involving 10000+ entries) in the assignments has been erased, to avoid excessive scrolling on Github.
